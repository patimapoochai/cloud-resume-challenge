## Purpose
This is a repository containing my implementation of the [Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) on AWS. I'm currently working through chunk 1 with hosting a static resume site on the AWS infrastructure. This was made for me to gain hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure operations, Infrastructure-as-Code, and CI/CD.

## Features
- Front-end site created with Next.js
- IaC using Terraform
- Hosted on AWS using S3, Cloudfront, and Route53

## Work in Progress
- GitHub CI/CD pipeline
- Chunk 2 (soon)
