## Purpose
This is a repository containing my front end code for the [Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). This was made for me to gain hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure operations, Infrastructure-as-Code, and CI/CD.

## Features
- Front end site created with Next.js
- Visitor count written in Javascript
- Back end infrastructure made with DynamoDB and Lambda
- Hosted on AWS using S3, Cloudfront, and Route53
- IaC using Terraform
- End-to-end tests written with Cypress
- CI/CD with Github Actions
